            <p class="project-text">SWMT is a web-GIS based software designed to revolutionize DMA (District Metered Area) management. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, SWMT offers a comprehensive solution for efficient and sustainable water distribution. It is the official DMA management software of Dhaka WASA, which is the largest water service provider in Southeast Asia.</p>
            <h5 class="activities-title">Description</h5>
            <p class="project-text">SDMT is a web-based software accessible from anywhere in the world via any internet browser, eliminating the need for installations or software downloads. Its intuitive design and robust functionality empower users to optimize DMA management from anywhere, anytime.</p>
            <p class="project-text">Some of the key features are:</p>
            <ul class="activities-list tick-list project-text">
                <li>Users can gain access to comprehensive DMA information from multiple shapefiles, GeoJSON files, APIs, and databases. </li>
                <li>SWMT enables the users to perform queries on the existing DMA assets (i.e., valves, pipelines, PTW, DMA chambers, service connections, transmission lines, injection points), modify their attributes, change their location, edit the geometry, delete assets, and add new DMA assets.</li>
                <li>Through server interconnection and API, SWMT fetches billing data from the MIS server of Dhaka WASA and uses this information to calculate NRW and display the billing anomalies on web maps. Besides, it automatically displays the calculated NRW results on separate dashboards. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="activities-list tick-list project-text">
                <li>SWMT has a secure login system. It has two versions, one version is accessible by the general users (we call it Readonly Version), another version is accessible by only authorized persons (Edit Version). In the Readonly Version, users can only view web maps and make queries. On the contrary, in the Edit Version, users can edit the data in real-time.</li>
                <li>In SWMT, data can be dynamically updated in real-time. Therefore, it contains the up-to-date data of Dhaka WASA. These spatial data can be downloaded directly from SWMT both in GeoJSON format and Excel files. </li>

            <p>There are two layers for the buildings (3D polygons). The active layer shows the population distribution in the buildings through color gradient. And another layer (inactive one) shows the average billed amount for each building for the last two years. You can make the tick mark on to see this layer. Other District Metered Area (DMA) assets like- valves, pipelines, chambers, deep tube wells, consumer connections etc. are in 3D too. You may zoom in and click on any layer to see its attributes. If the attributes are not showing, try after turning off the ‘Zone 2 boundary’ layer.
            </p>
            <p>You can also play with the shadow tool or try different base maps from the ‘Basemap Gallery’. These options are available in the ribbon located in upper-right corner. </p>

            <p>To load the 3D models, I am using the Three.js library. I keep the .gltf files in a folder on my server and store the file names in my database.
